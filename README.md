## **Build & Configuration Log**
* **Hardware Assembly:** Executed precision cable management to optimise airflow and aesthetics within a mid-tower chassis.
* **Thermal Management:** Configured a custom fan curve; performed 2-hour stress tests using **Prime95** and **FurMark** to verify stability.
* **BIOS Tuning:** Updated BIOS to the latest revision, enabled EXPO profiles for rated RAM speeds, and configured Secure Boot.
* **OS & Drivers:** Clean installation of Windows 11 Pro, including chipset drivers and GPU optimisation.

## **Performance Benchmarks**
* **Cinebench R23:** 13,700 (Multi-Core)
* **Idle Temp / Max Load Temp:** 32°C / 64°C
* **Boot Time:** 9 seconds
